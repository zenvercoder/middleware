# Notes

### Install the entire thing with three lines of code in the terminal:

* `express --hbs optionalname` (middeware)(cd into folder)

* `npm install`

* `npm start` (starts server)(or nodemon)


### You should already have installed...

`npm init -y` (made a json)(-y = yes to everything)

(express generator already installed with
`npm install express-generator -g` you're good until you have a different computer. just type express from now on)

(gitignore)
`npm install gitignore -g`
